                My name Veasna Sreng. I'm living in various place, most of the time I live in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital city.
                I'm graduate in 2010 as a software engineer. Previously I'd been working in a few componay such as Wings,
                Golden Gekko (Now became DMI), Asiacell.
                <br><br>
                I've been working on front-end and backend. Thought implementation of backend and front-end are different,
                I love being involve in both side and being understand the difficulty and challenging on both side allow me
                to find a better way to solve problem while keeping thing simple. Challenging and solving problem is my favorite part,
                sometime it's difficult, however it provide a great deal as I got to discover what I haven't yet to know.
                <br><br>
                I love open source communities and love to develop something awesome and amazing.
